            that occupies special places in both Hindu and Buddhist traditions.
            According to Hindu mythology, the Himalayas are the abode of the

            Several of the festivals of Nepal last from one to several days. As
            a predominantly Hindu and Buddhist nation, most of the Nepalese
            festivals are religious ones. The festivals of Nepal have their
            roots in Hinduism as more than 80% of the population of the country
            is Hindu. Buddhism, the second-largest religion of the nation which
            accounts for 9% of the population, has influenced the cultural
            festivals of Nepal. Dashain or Vijaya Dashami is the longest and the
            most important festival of Nepal. Generally, Dashain falls in late
            September to mid-October, right after the end of the monsoon season.
            It is "a day of Victory over Demons". The Newars celebrate the
            festival as Mohani, Tihar or Dipawali, Holi, Saraswati Puja,
            Rakshabandhan, Bhai Dooj, Janmashtami, Gai Jatra, Nag Panchami,
            Teej, Chhath, Kartik Poornima, Maghe Sankranti, or Makar Sankranti
            Maha Shivratri and Chhechu are widely celebrated important festivals
            of Nepal. New Year's Day of the lunar calendar Nepal Sambat occurs
            in November. <br />

            are declared in some regions. Other important festivals include
            Buddha Purnima (the celebration of the birth of Buddha) Maha
            Shivaratri (a festival of Lord Shiva) and during Maha Shivaratri
            festivities, some people consume excessive drinks and smoke charas.
            Sherpas, mostly located at higher altitudes and in the Mount Everest
            region, celebrate Mani Rimdu, for the good of the world. Most
            festivals include dancing and music, and a variety of special foods
