            In fact, some Nepalese even refer to it as “Deepawali”. Its timing
            is based on the new moon of the Hindu month Kartika, but extends two
            days before and after that event. Thus, it is a five-day festival.
            On the Western calendar, it comes in either November or October,
            varying year to year. While each Hindu ethnic group in Nepal
            celebrates Tihar in slightly different ways, the main outlines
            remain the same everywhere. The season is called “the Festival of
            Lights” after the clay lanterns (“diyas”) that are lit and stacked
            around houses every night. People use pigmented rice, flour, sand,
            and flower petals to make “rangoli,” which are decorative patterns
            on the floors of homes and outdoor areas. They are meant to honour
            and welcome various Hindu gods and goddesses to the home. Also of
            high importance is the honouring of various animals during Tihar,
            which will be mentioned in more detail just below.

            On the five days of Tihar, the following traditions are commonly
            practiced in Nepal: <br />
        </p>
        <div id="list">
            <p>
                <span id="hdl">Day One:</span>
                On this day, crows and ravens are worshiped and fed sweet foods
                and delicacies, which are left for them to find on Hindu roof
                tops. The caw-caw of the gathering crows is a symbol of sadness
                to Hindus, and feeding the crows is thought to prevent various
                calamities. <br />
                <br />
                <span id="hdl">Day Two:</span>
                is the day of the dogs. Dogs are thought to be messengers of the
                god of death and are worshipped on this day every year. You will
                see dogs wearing wreaths, and bearing red or white dots (“tika”)
                on their foreheads. <br />
                <br />
                <span id="hdl">Day Three:</span>
                In the morning of day three, cows are worshipped. They are
                thought to be symbols of prosperity, and so wreaths and tika are
                also placed upon them. On the evening of the third day, the
                Hindu goddess of wealth is honoured by lighting up oil lamps in
                doorways and windows of homes. Music, singing, and dancing are
                also done door-to-door in exchange for tips. Those tipped spend
                the night counting up their new-found wealth. <br />
                <br />
                <span id="hdl">Day Four:</span>
                On the fourth day, oxen are worshipped in much the same way as
                the cows and dogs. Some, though not all Hindus, worship toward
                Goverdhan mountain on this day and make a “mini-mountain” of cow
                dung to represent it. Wasting nothing, even dung is commonly
                made use of in Nepal. <br />
                <br />
                <span id="hdl">Day Five:</span>
                The final day of Tihar has sisters putting tika on their
                brother's foreheads to secure for them a long and happy life.
                This tradition is based on the story of a Hindu goddess who did
                the same to her brother. At special ceremonies, sisters encircle
                brothers and put seven-coloured tika on their foreheads, and
                gifts are also exchanged.
