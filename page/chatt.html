            The Hindus among Maithili regions of Nepal and India celebrate
            Chhath festival, which is also known as Surya Shashti. The Sun,
            considered as the god of energy and of the life force, is worshipped
            during the Chhath festival to promote well-being, prosperity and
            progress. In Hinduism, Sun worship is believed to help cure a

            variety of diseases, including leprosy, and helps ensure the
            longevity and prosperity of family members, friends, and elders.

            Chhath Parva is observed for 4 days from Kartik Shukla Chaturthi to
            Kartik Shukla Saptami. This festival falls in October or November in
            the English Calendar. Chhath is also celebrated on Chaitra Shashti,
            the early summer about March or April, and is called Chaiti Chhath.
            They include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking
            water (Vratta), standing in water for long periods of time, and
            offering Prasad (prayer offerings) and Arghya to the setting and
            rising sun. Chhath Festival is mostly celebrated in the Terai part
            of Nepal.

        <h3>Legends Behind the Festival Celebration</h3>
        <p>
            There is a legend that Chhath was celebrated because the times of
            Mahabharat, Draupadi, the wife of Pandava Kings, performed Chhath
            Puja. Once during the long exile from their kingdom, thousands of
            <img

            wandering hermits visited their hut. Being devout Hindus, the
            Pandavas were obliged to feed the monks. But as exiles, the Pandavas
            were not in a position to offer food to so many hungry hermits.
            Seeking a quick solution, Draupadi approached Saint Dhaumya, who
            advised her to worship Surya and observe the rituals of the Chhath
            for prosperity and abundance. <br />
            Some texts linked with the Holy epic Ramayana resembles the
            association of Lord Rama and Sita. According to the texts, Rama and
            Sita offered prayers to the god of light-sun after getting back from
            the 14 years long exile. On the month of Kartika Shukla Paksha, Rama
            and Sita offered their prayers to Sun from Ayodhya. This festival
            then emerged as a significant tradition of worshipping the Sun. This
            festival is remarkably observed after Deepawali and lasts for four
            days.
